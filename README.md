# Project

**Project Name - Long version**

Template github repository that can be used e.g. for the publication of the code when submitting a paper. 
GH Actions are set to:
1) convert the ipynb to html, create an index html page and store all the pages in a separate branch, where they can be published as static website with github pages
2) create a README index file for the repo that contains all the links to the html and ipynb files.
Feel free to fork it for "publishing" your own notebooks, and I am obviously open to suggestions for improvements.


An html version of the notebooks is accessible [here](https://matbonfanti.github.io/project-template/).

Links: [jupyter notebook](prova.ipynb) and [html file](https://matbonfanti.github.io/project-template/prova.html).
